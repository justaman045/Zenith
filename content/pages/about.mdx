Hey, I'm Aman, a Learning frontend Enginner, content creator, and digital nomad, with corporate slave.
I create content about Development on this blog. I've freelanced as a full-stack developer since my teenage years, and in 2023, I started writing this blog. Let's learn and support each other on this journey!

## What's the point of blogging?

- I believe you can learn a lot by following other people's journeys. I'm following a lot of other creators too.
- Through social media and public building, I get to meet interesting people and we can support each other.

## What kind of stuff do you find here?

Videos, blogs, tips, and discussions.
