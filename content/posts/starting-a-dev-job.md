# Starting a Dev Job as Operation Executive

## Pre Joining time

Hello folks,

it's been a very long time since I've posted any of the Dev Update, Basically I was out for a week long trip to Ghaziabad at my Aunts home, It was nice visiting her and my cousins.

But It's the 25th of October, The Day of Joining as a Operation Executive at Infosys.

## Morning Time

So it's 9 AM and it's time that my First Ever Joining of My Dev Job, and It's _Regina Vaz_ our Host for the Induction Program she lead the Program with her team it was like a Proud moment to be a **_Infoscion_**.

## Lunch Break

So literally after 3 Hours of Video Call it's time for Lunch, I rather played **CSGO** to my heart's Content. I just missed this a very much ðŸ¤­.

So Post Lunch Break was a bit of theory lecture type Session where we learnd about Infosys and our Steps if some mis fortune happened in Infosys and who shall we report to and etc.

## It's time to wind up for today

So at 5 PM it's time to wind up for the First Day and now it's time for QnA session related to Launchpad Dashboard that's being used to Upload the Personal Info to the Infosys Internet

## After the Job time

So After the Job timme got over, I Just Played Assassin's Creed Unity and wrote this article for a Dev Feed Update.

BTW I'm thinking to start a New Project that's a bit of Surprise but I'll reach out to you with Newsletter _if you have subscribed to it_.
