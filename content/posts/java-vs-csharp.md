description: In this article, we'll discuss what are the differences between Java and C#
---

Both C# and Java have a stronghold in Industry level requirements and they both hold a strong position in the world of Development, either be it Development or Testing, C# is also known as the Language for Game Development on the other hand Java was the Language for Android Development for a long time until Kotlin was Introduced which is also built on top of Java.

There are many similarities among both between them, sometimes they both seem very identical in both ways be it syntax or the way they behave on certain lines of code. In this article, we'll understand what is the difference between both Languages.

## Java

Java is a Statically Typed language that follows the rules of Object Oriented Programming founded by James Gosling in the year 1995 with the core concept of writing once and running anywhere. It is a platform Independent language that can run on any Operating System either be it Windows, Linux, Mac, or even Smartphones or Feature Phones.

### Characteristics of Java

- Java is a Platform Independent, Object Oriented Programing Language
- It can run on any Platform which has Java JDK installed on that system.
- It is designed to develop Applications that can also interact with the Internet.

### Advantages of Java

Java as a Language has many advantages for many scenarios in the World of Development. Some of them are listed below:

- Detailed Documentation online
- Offers a large pool of Java Developers in today's world.
- Code Reusability
- Muti-Threading
- High in Performance
- Huge number of Libraries

### Dis-Advantages

With Advantages it also comes with its Dis-Advantages, Some of which are listed below:

- JIT( Just In Time) compiler makes the Java Program slower in Execution.
- Java Programs demand high resources and computing Power.
- Java doesn't provide any support for low-level programming concepts like Pointer.
- No Control over Garbage Collection which is done by default in Java.

## C#

Back when Games Gosling developed Java in 1995, Microsoft too worked on its Object Oriented Programming language which can even entirely replace Java from the market. So Microsoft Worked on Its language named C-Sharp denoted as `C#`.

C# provides modern features with simpler code than Java making C# the best alternative today for Language with Object Oriented Programming Language.

### Characteristic of C#

C# is a language that offers multiple characteristics, some of which are listed below:

- Support for Automatic Garbage collection
- Offers Standard Library
- Conditional Compilation
- Assembly Versioning
- Great Integration with Windows

### Advantages with C#

C# has a great number of Advantages over other Programming languages that a developer can take advantage of, some of them are listed below:

- Backed by Tech Giant Microsoft Corporation
- Easy Extension methods
- Automated Memory Management
- Automated Garbage Collection
- Properties with Get and Set methods

### Disadvantages of C#

- Bad in GUI
- Lex Flexibility because it only runs on .NET Applications
- High Learning Curve
- Code gets compiled every time whenever the changes are made.

## Difference between C# and Java

### Creation

C# Was developed by Microsoft after the initial release of Java by Sun Microsystems in 2000.

### Polymorphism

Java Invokes the `virtual` keyword in the base class to override a function in the `derived` class, whereas in C# it enables Polymorphism by Default.

### Designed for

Java was developed to run Applications developed in Java on any platform _( which has JRE ( Java Runtime Environment) installed )_, whereas in C# it is designed to be run on CLR _( Common Language Runtime )_.

### Typesafe

Java is Type safe which means the variables declared of one type cannot change their value overall duration of Program Execution while in C# it is not Typesafe.

### API Control

Java's API is entirely controlled by Open Community Process, whereas in C# the API is controlled by Open Source Community.

### Public Classes

In C# there can only be one Public Class in an Entire Program else there will be a compilation Error, while in C# it can have many public classes.

### Conditional Compilation

C# is a Language that supports the conditional Compilation of a Program whereas Java doesn't support conditional Compilation.

### Applications

Java produces Complex Console based Applications whereas C# produces Web and Game programs which also helps Windows Developers to play games with a wide variety of choices.

## Important Differences between Both of Them

### Importing Packages

In Java, we use the `import` keyword to import other files and functions whereas in C# we use the `using` keyword to do the same.

### Printing Statements

In Java to Print a single line we have to import a Particular package to print `System.out.println` whereas in C# we can directly access `Console.WriteLine` to print anything on the console.

### Operator Overloading

Java Doesn't support Operator Overloading while C# does support this.

### Inheritance

Inheritance in Java is performed using the `Extends` Keyword whereas in C# we use the `Using` keyword.

## Selenium Testing with Both Languages

### Using C#

- Less help is available online compared to Java
- Visual Studio is available for C# coding
- NUnit framework
- The look and feel of the Visual Studio are relatively better than Eclipse
- Manual efforts are necessary for Selenium with C# for creating Test Execution reports within

### Using Java

- Many websites are available as online help for automation testing
- Eclipse is used widely for Java coding
- JUnit framework where just ANT is used for generating Test Execution Report.
- TestNG framework that allows the developers or testers to put much effort into creating Test Execution Reports and they can also have different annotations/parameters for using with.
- TestNG allows the developers and testers to rerun the failed test cases which are the important parts of test execution.

## Conclusion

So, it can be said that both of these programming languages have a great demand in the market but Java is a good choice compared to C#. But it entirely depends on your interest in what language you want. And there are plenty of online resources available from where you can learn Selenium with C# or Selenium with Java.
