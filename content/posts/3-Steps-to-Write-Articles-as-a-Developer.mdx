# 3 Great Tips that will make your Technical Blogs which people will actually read

First of all let's be clear why you are writing a Technical Blog Post. There are many of them who will be writing the Blogs because of many Reasons:

- Some will have the reason of having a good impression on their future HR managers.
- To Apply recently Learned knowledge

It does not matter whatever your Reasons are and why you are blogging.

**Just Write some good _stuff, Stuff that people will actually read_**.

To write some content that people will actually read, you must have these 3 most important things in your Article.

1. Substance
2. Packaging
3. Publicising

## 1. Substance

Write something that matters to others.

**_Pro Tip_** - All the buzz words in the world can't save your ass, If it doesnot have _substance_.

**Do your Homework**

Know the topic you are writing about and what have been previously written about it.
Once your Homework is done, Now figureout what's missing.

At a point you might even think of why should I write these blogs about the things which have been already written.

Well, you know everyone have their reason to read your blog oveer other, Some of the reasons can be

- Relatable Experience Level
- Level of Detail
- Language or Tech/Tool specific
- Diffrent Example/ Application
- Humor ( Optional )

With over these many excuse to read your blog, many of them will read yours too.

## 2. Packaging

Packaging on a Blog Post can be diffrentiated in 4 particualr parts

Most Famous Blogs being :

- Own Blog

## 3. Publicizing

Publicizing is the most lenghty part of writing Tech Blog Post as in Developing Coding is only the 10% but the Publicity for it makes the next 90% of the Developement process.

You can use Hackernews for Publicising it, It is completly Random but you have to take you chance whenever it will come on top you blog will just make it.

You can also use Facebook Groups specific to it, That thing also works.

I would Recommend that you should also use other's people's audience, But that doesn't mean to spam his Comment Box just be a decent looking Blogger who is in need for a better audience not a spammer who is being a Blogger.
