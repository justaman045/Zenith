# Why Linux is popular among Programmers

You may have heard about almost every programmer who is referring and recommending you to code and use Linux If you are into the Programming world. **But why??** Why everyone is recommending Linux, not [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows) also have been here for about more than a Decade then why??

Have you ever gotten stuck on this question?

That's the question I once got up to and was having difficulty finding a perfect answer to this. But when I started using **[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com) as my Primary OS** then I found the answer to this question on my own.

But don't worry you don't have to switch to Linux like I did all at once. In this article, I will tell you about the main 8 points that force a Developer to use Linux [ But it's not compulsory even after these 8 Points.

## 1. Security

So as you may have heard **Linux **distribution** is Open** Sorce Operating System\*\* by which everyone refers that its source code is available for everyone to see and modify according to their need.

That also invited some people to spot a Bug in the OS and attack other users for stealing data or some other harmful practice, So you might think that this is a major threat to the users' Data.

But the main reason for which everyone uses Linux Distros is that Linux is very popular these days so you can assume that if a Single person is attacking another user with Linux vulnerability then there are thousands of Developers to prevent the user from that attack.

Also unlike [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows) here, the possibility of getting a virus is almost negligible right now so you can surf the Internet without the fear of viruses and you don't have to purchase any kind of Antivirus Software and pay for them.

Also **In **the Linux environment**,** almost every\*\* **software is free.\*\***

## 2. It Can Improve your workflow

To understand this point you must have a basic knowledge of **Package Manager**.

A Package Manager is something that helps you to install something and Update the same. In [Windows OS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows) or Mac OS, you have to configure it sometimes and if you are using Pirated copy of [Windows OS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows) then you might never use the official package manager of [Windows OS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows).

But in Linux, you get the package manager pre-installed and pre-configured. All you have to do to install in Linux is

> For Debian based distros

`Sudo apt-get install what-ever-you-want-to-install`

and after typing this in the terminal in a couple of minutes you will get that software for free and with ease.

Let's suppose you want to install a VLC media player

- ### In Windows

In [Windows OS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows) you have to first download the Setup from the official website and then you have to hit next next next until a progress bar appears

- ### In Linux

`sudo apt-get install vlc`

## 3. No Rebooting

In Linux, you don't have to reboot your system just to use a particular piece of software.

You can even Update the Distro and still no reboot, which I guess you will be able to do in neither Windows OS nor macOS but yea you have to reboot after the kernel Upgrade as Linux is a Kernal.
As Programmers, we use to install many different technologies and dependencies related to it. So Linux takes care of it completely so that we don't have to reboot the system frequently.

This is the main reason why Linux has been chosen for Servers for Big Companies. It has been chosen for **_Stability_** and **_Reliability_**. Many of the Linux servers are today running like a charm even without a reboot for more than a couple of months.

## 4. Linux comes with Powerful Programming Tools

Most of the Linux Distro come pre-installed with programming tools like grep, cron, and others.

This is the stuff that is completely optional and depends on the user. Maybe you want a completely clean OS and you want to manually install all the things you want _OR_ you can just get a copy of the pre-installed OS from the internet for Free.

Even nowadays VS Codium comes pre-installed with [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/) which is for Pentesting and Hacking things.

## 5. Automation

Linux is almost developed for automation and Stuff. I barely see any Linux user repeat any task again and again.

Maybe you have to add a new product to your E-commerce platform, you can automate that part and by that time you will Netflix and Chill.

By the way checkout [RushX](https://rushx.pythonanywhere.com), I Developed this as my project and now I want to expand this as an Open Source project with a little income for me to survive in this COVID situation.

## 6. Performance

No, a Linux will not be blazing fast so you must replace your Primary OS with any of the Linux Distro

But instead, it will be compatible with any of the devices out there and still work like charm. It will give you a performance increase when it will be given the same amount of Hardware resources when compared to Windows and macOS.

It will revive your almost Dead PC or Laptop which you haven't upgraded in terms of Hardware and still give you the same speed when compared with Windows with 3 GB Ram and HDD

## 7. Useful Error Messages

In Windows based on my experience whenever you get an error in that you just get a simple error of
`Oops! Something went wrong` and that's all.

But in Linux, you will get the actual reason for the error message. Like today I was Installing Flutter on my Primary machine on which I use [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com) I got the reason for the error but in Windows, I remember that I use to get the error message of `flutter toolkit not set properly`.

## 8. Customization

In Linux you will get to customize almost everything in the OS, In Windows or macOS there is a chance you will get the tweaks for some but not for all. In Linux, you get control over everything.

And if you want to see at which level Linux can be customized Comment down below and I will write an article about that too.

# Conclusion

There isn't anything that cannot be done on other OS but only in Linux. An OS is just an interface between the Hardware and the User.

It is just the ease of working in the environment.

The question arises that will I recommend you to use Linux, So it's a big **YES** first start with using Linux with Live USB or with a Virtual Machine that will give you the experience.

If you want to get an article about installing Linux in Virtual Machine or setting up your own on-the-go Linux Machine with just a USB comment down below I will write an article on that too.

## How I got started with Linux

I started using Linux with Live USB on my Intel Core 2 Duo with 3 GB Ram and it worked out like a charm on it.

Then I moved to Hostel because of my graduation where I got my first laptop with basic specs of AMD A6 processor with 4 GB Ram which I installed as a Primary OS which I am currently running while writing this article.

At first, I was breaking things very frequently but soon I got a bit familiar with that environment I became the best Linux user of my Hostel as I won a competition (Un-Offical).

After Introducing this much about Linux to you what do you think about using Linux? Comment down below and I will love to hear from you.
