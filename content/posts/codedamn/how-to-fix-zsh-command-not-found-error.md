# How to fix the "zsh command not found" error

Developers these days already know the power of a Terminal instead of the regular GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) which the Linux environment is more focused on these days. Though it might seem very hard and challenging to use it when compared to GUI but believe me, it's a thousand times more convenient, powerful, and useful when it comes to a career as a Developer. If you want additional features which are not included by default in bash then you might want to use `zsh` which is also used as an Interactive login shell for Linux and Mac. `Zsh` which is built on top of Bash with many improvements including some features from ksh and tcsh too. After having features from all these programs it becomes a very powerful program to use. `Zsh` is also known as Z shell.

But sometimes most of us might also have faced the error termed as

```bash
zsh: command not found
```

to which we'll discuss the most common errors that lead to this error, and their solutions.

## Common Reasons for this Error

There may be multiple reasons for this error and processes to reproduce this error, but in this article, we'll discuss the most common reasons for this Error.

- Not Valid Command
- The package is not Installed
- The mis-spelling of the command
- Package not on the Path
- Package not installed/available in .zshrc file

## Why `zsh` instead of `Bash`??

Bash often comes pre-installed and configured in Linux Distro, It's powerful and more than enough when you're to use many features. But when you want to use features like Automatic CD, recursive path expansion, and others, you have to use `zsh` instead of `Bash``.

### Solution 1 - Check whether your command is valid or not

If any command doesn't work, it's the first thing that you double-check is if the command is correct or not, Most of the time users make mistakes in typing the commands.

Let's look at an Example

If we're trying to run a command to clear the Terminal Screen and you're coming from Windows Background, you may write `cls` instead of `clear`,

So instead of getting a clear screen, you'll get

```bash
dev-ubuntu% cls
zsh: command not found: cls
```

#### To fix this

try using a Package named [`thefuck`](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck), which will correct your previous command of the console.

### Solution 2 - Check if Command is not misspelled

The second most rule that a User follows if they get a `command not found` error is that check the spelling of the command, Checking whether it is a valid command or not still at first.

Let's Look at the Example

If we're trying to run a command with a wrong spelling the Linux Terminal will not be able to identify the command, resulting in not being able to execute the command.

Let's try to run `netstat` with the spelling `nestat`, which eventually will result in not being able to execute the command.

```bash
dev-ubuntu% nestat
zsh: command not found: nestat
```

#### To Fix this

Check the command for its name or use the [`thefuck`](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) package to rectify the command.

### Solution 3 - Make sure the Package is installed on your System

Many times it happens that due to some reason a User has to uninstall the package but still after uninstalling the package the user tries to access the command resulting in _Command not found Error_

Let's take an Example

If we're trying to access the `npm` package but the package `npm` is not installed on the system, or if we're trying to access the `react` package but it's not on the path or installed at the _global_ level, it'll result in _Command_ not Found\* Error.

```bash
dev-ubuntu% npm
zsh: command not found: npm
```

#### To Fix this

try running the command to Install the package which you're trying to access or hit this command

```bash
sudo apt install package-name
```

### Solution 4 - Make sure the command is accessible and on $PATH

Most of the time it happens that the command is not on the Path, but still, the user is trying to access the Package.

For Example

If you're trying to access the package which is not on the $PATH, it'll result in the error of _Command not Found_.

```bash
dev-ubuntu% npm
zsh: command not found: npm
```

#### To Fix this

Try adding the location of the package to the $PATH
Unix users can try running this command

```bash
export "$PATH:/home/coderaman7/.local/.bash"
```

### Solution 5 - Setup `.zshrc` file to export your Paths

Sometimes due to some error or mishandling, the `.zshrc` file gets deleted which will eventually result in loss of Data and the command not being able to execute, due to misconfigurations of the PATHS.

#### To fix this

- Create a new file at the root of your Machine named `.zshrc`try by running the command `export "$PATH:/home/coderaman7/.local/.bash"`

## Conclusion

As discussed in this article, 5 main and common problems will cause the Error `zsh: command not found`. If you've tried all of these and it successfully ran. The Error might have gone away and you're back with your package accessible again.
