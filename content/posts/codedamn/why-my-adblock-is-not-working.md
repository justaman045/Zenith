# Why my Adblock is not Working

Many users use Adblock to prevent Ads from spamming websites with unnecessary information and history-revealing ads. Adblocks is just a JavaScript file that automatically detects the Ads and stops them from being rendered onto the Document/Website.

However, sometimes it has been seen that users face a problem where the AdBlock doesn't block the ads. Many users have reported that they've already tried multiple Adblocks but still the ads continue to pop up.

Ads can be frustrating most of the time and it's frustrating when it's the point when you know you've tried everything but still, it isn't working.

However if you want to block those ads that the Twitch Streamer / YouTube Creator has inserted the ads right in the Vods, then any AdBlock cannot block the ads in that case.

#### There are multiple common reasons for Adblocks not working :

- You've not updated the filtering list
- You've whitelisted the website
- You've misconfigured the settings

### Not Updated the Adblock list

Sometimes the auto-update AdBlock list doesn't work and you've to manually update the list, due to that reason the Adblock might not work on the system.

### Continue without disabling

Sometimes websites allow the users to view the content on their website without disabling the AdBlock which as the result spawns one or two ads but not a bulk like when you've disabled the AdBlock.

### Mis-configured settings

It might be sometimes that you've misconfigured the settings of the AdBlock, which leads to bypassing the ads from the filtering list.

### Show Acceptable Ads

Sometimes users keep the option of showing acceptable ads enabled which leads to showing the ads to spawn on the website.

Acceptable ads are those ads that are not interfering with the content and are clearly written with the word `advertisement` and hereby follow the standards of the ads.

### Conflict with other extensions

Sometimes it can happen that the Adblock you've installed is having issues with another AdBlock you've installed.

For Example:- If you've installed Adblock and Adblock Plus then they might have compatibility issues.

### Try using different Adblock instead

Sometimes it can happen that the Region is affecting the list of the Adblock and you might have to look for a different one.

Try [uBlock Origin](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak?hl=en-US) ( We recommend this because of its dynamic adblocking as Adblock and Adblock Plus are developed by keeping YouTube in mind ).

### Try using Different Browser

After all these steps you might want to use something which just automatically does all the AdBlock stuff for you and you just do your work. We'll introduce you to Brave Browser which is based on Chromium Browser but has different features ( unique to its own ) Brave Adblock is the most secure and already installed AdBlock you'll get right after installing this browser.

The best part of this is it focuses on the Privacy of the user more than on monitoring the user's activity ( like in Google Chrome ).

### Conclusion

Here in this article, we've discussed the different reasons why AdBlock is not working and also saw the solutions and alternatives if it's broken. Try using anyone you'd like and comment down below which one of the above worked out for you.
