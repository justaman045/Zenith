Developing A Bot to Send Multiple Messages to a Single Person

## Pre Developement Phase

So I'll be Taking the Help of my previous Version of the Project where i've Developed this Project with using Functions and the Regular Python3.

## The Idea

The Idea Behind this Project is to Develop a Bot

- that will take the Number of the Recipent's WhatsApp and
- then validate that Number if that is Real Number or Fake using some API get requests
- If the Number is Genuine
- It will Proceed by Obtaining the Message from the User
- If the Message is not given to the Bot then It will search for a Excel file ( Or CSV ) which will contain multiple Messages
- If the Number gets to be Fake then it will prompt to re-enterthe Number else the User can Quit

All of this will be Going through some best UI with Python
