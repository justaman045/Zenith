## JavaScript Introduction

Welcome to the basics of the JavaScript introductory Article.

In this article and some future articles, I will try to cover the fundamentals of JavaScript that will be understandable by a complete beginner also and will make him a good JavaScript programmer.

So let's start from the very basics

## What is JavaScript??

So What is JavaScript??

JavaScript is the most popular and widely used programming language in the world. As per the StackOverflow survey, it stands above all of the other programming languages ( at the number 1 position ), and also big companies like **Netflix**, **Facebook**,**Google** all of them use _JavaScript_ to develop their Applications.

As a _JavaScript_ developer you can be able to earn up to 72,000 USD all over **United States of America**. You can work as a _Frontend Developer_, _Backend Developer_ and even as a _Full Stack Developer_ **just by learning JavaScript**.

## What can you do with JavaScript??

Previously JavaScript was only used to develop the web pages interactive even it was also considered as a _toy language_

##### But wait a minute JavaScript was considered a _toy language_ and it was not even developed for programing purposes??

So you read it right **JavaScript** was not developed as a Programming tool instead it was developed as a toy language.

**But what is toy language??**

Toy language is said to a language whenever a programming language is not capable of developing some high-end applications. As we all know that earlier JavaScript was only executable in browsers.

But after the huge investments by big companies like _Google_, _Facebook_ and more it has become far more than anyone could even think of ( not even its developers thought that their developed language can go up this far ).

Today you can develop many things from JavaScript like

- Complete web or Mobile Apps
- Networking / Chat App
- Command-line tools
- Even Games also

## Where does JavaScript Code runs??

JavaScript was previously designed to run only in browsers, Every browser has its JavaScript Engine that can execute the JavaScript Code.

Firefox has its JavaScript engine known as _SpiderMonkey_ and Chrome also does have its separate JavaScript Engine known as _v8_.

In 2009, an Engineer named **Rian** took the Open Source JavaScript Engine of Chrome and embedded it inside a C++ program. That was the beginning of Modern JavaScript to which he called **Node**.

So **Node** is a C++ Program consisting of a JavaScript engine, with the help of Node we can execute the JavaScript code ( or logic ) outside of a browser.

## What is the difference between _ECMAScript_ and _JavaScript_??

**ECMAScript** is just a specification whereas **JavaScript** is a programing language that follows the specifications.

The first version of ECMAScript was released in 1997 and then from 2015 ECMAScript has been continuously working on the annual releases. In 2015 they released ES2015 which we also know by the name of ES6. This specification specified many new features for JavaScript which we will cover in a separate post.

_So we have been done with the hell of the theory and history of JavaScript_ Now let's get our hands dirty by writing some code in JavaScript

## JavaScript Coding

### Step 1

Open up your favorite browser (preferred will be Chrome / Firefox / Edge [ as I am a Windows user So sorry to macOS user ])

### Step 2

Right-click on any available free space and click on _Inspect_.

### Step 3

Select the _Console_ tab on the Inspector.

### Step 4

write this code and see the magic of **JavaScript**.

`console.log('Hello World');`

you should get the output as

`Hello World`

### Step 5

let's get another example

write this code

`alert('Hello I am JavaScript Engine');`

this time you will get a prompt saying that

`Hello I am JavaScript Engine`

Well so for a basic Introduction about JavaScript

We will cover all the JavaScript basics from function to Classes

from classes to spreaders and all

## Conclusion

So as a Developer if you want a decent Job in a Front-end or Backend Developer position then you should consider learning JavaScript as it will also benefit you if you moved to develop mobile or web apps with React Native being the framework.
